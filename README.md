# IPL-Prediction
Used <b>Python</b> to create a machine learning Algorithm based on the data to calculate the results like top batsman with maximum runs scored in all the seasons, strike rate, maximum sixes and fours. Best fielder and best bowler throughout the seasons. Used TABLEAU for data visualization.

Here are insights of <b>TABLEAU</b>: <br><br>
First, here is the <b>python code</b> for the calculations of <b>the Best Batsman</b> by finding his total runs, total strike rate, maximum sixes and fours in all the seasons.</br>
